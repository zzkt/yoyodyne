* Invoice template

A simple script  for generating pdf invoices from text files.

The template and workflow is build upon  [[https://amyfare.ca/files/simple_invoice_template.tex][LaTeX Simple Invoice Template]] by Amy Fare (CC BY 4.0) and  [[https://github.com/mrzool/invoice-boilerplate][invoice-boilerplate]] by Mattia Tezzele (GPL2)

* Requirements
- an XeLaTeX environment such as [[https://tug.org/texlive/][TeX Live]]or [[https://miktex.org/][MiKTeX]]
- [[https://pandoc.org/][pandoc]]
- python or guile (or possibly an other scheme)

* Instructions for use
 - copy/edit =invoice-example.yaml= (invoice file must end in =.yaml=)
 - generate  pdf via =./generate-invoice.py invoice.yaml=

* Template variables

The source file is text in YAML format. The following variables and their values are substituted into the invoice (note that the ’from’ details are hardcoded for now)

| invoice-number                             |                               |
| invoice-date                               |                               |
| invoice-due                                |                               |
| invoice-to                                 | name of recipient             |
| address-1, address-2, address-3, address-4 | address can use up to 4 lines |
| VAT-id                                     |                               |

invoice lines itemizing products or services can be included as part of a =service= list

| description | description of the item                  |
| quantity    |                                          |
| unit-price  |                                          |
| vat-rate    |                                          |
| total       | line total including any VAT & discounts |
| details     | (not used)                               |

The subtotal, taxes and invoice total

| invoice-subtotal |
| invoice-VAT      |
| invoice-total    |

If required, the invoice can include a line about intra-community supply (for 0% VAT between EU entities) by setting =eu-zero= to =true= or =false=

| inside-eu | (unused)                                    |
| eu-zero   | will add note about “0% VAT” if set to =true= |

payment details (only configured for SEPA bank transfers)

| account-name |
| IBAN         |
| BIC          |

Adjust some of the typography and layout settings

| seriffont | e.g. Hoefler Text                                 |
| sansfont  | e.g. Fira Sans                                    |
| fontsize  | e.g. 10pt                                         |
| geometry  | e.g. left=43mm, right=43mm, top=51mm, bottom=17mm |
